# GC-Bank
alternative banking for the better (blockchain ledger)

This github page is for our "failover" front page for our [GC-Bank][GCB] plateform at its hosting service went down on Aug 6th 2018

the main idea is to have a "bifurcation" page that link to
 * <https://wwww.gc-bank.org> when the server is live, and
 * <https://michel47.github.io/GC-bank> when the server is at rest
 
[GCB]: http://gc-bank.org
